/**
 * Just like last time, the ATM class is responsible for managing all
 * of the user interaction. This means login procedures, displaying the
 * menu, and responding to menu selections. In the enhanced version, the
 * ATM class will have the added responsibility of interfacing with the
 * Database class to write and read information to and from the database.
 * 
 * Most of the functionality for this class should have already been
 * implemented last time. You can always reference my Github repository
 * for inspiration (https://github.com/rwilson-ucvts/java-sample-atm).
